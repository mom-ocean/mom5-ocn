This version is very close to MOM 5.0.2, but with infrastructure updates made to support more computer platforms; new and modified diagnostic capabilities; bug fixes as reported through the MOM community; and a new ecosystem model known as COBALT.  As a general rule for updating code, please test the new code by comparing to your earlier results.</p><p>Happy modeling, Stephen Griffies for the MOM development team.</p>"

It serves as a handy interface to the documentation already available within the source code. This page is automatically generated from the source code itself, so if you find any errors, or would like to make any improvements, this can be done by editing the code and submitting the changes to <a href=\"http://www.github.com/BreakawayLabs/mom\">github</a>.</p><p>The second feature is a <a href=\"/web/data\">data portal</a>.</p><p>This portal provides download links to all the test case data used by MOM. This data is usually accessed by <a href=\"/web/docs/git-annex\">git-annex</a> (which is still the preferred form of access). We have had a lot of feedback from people who havn't been able to use git-annex for various reasons, so this alternate download option will let you access the data as needed.</p><p>Both of these features should be considered as being in beta, so you might see some minor changes happening in the coming days. If you find any errors, broken links, etc, please let me know and I'll try to fix them up ASAP.</p>",
