            h2 #{project} Foundations

            p The following documents provide a description of the physical, mathematical, numerical, and computational foundations for the various versions of MOM.  They are provided here partly for their historical relevance, as well as for their pedagogical value.

                each doc in manual_docs

            h2 Model Development Lab Docs

            p These documents will help you use those parts of the Model Development Lab which are not specific to #{project}.

            ul
                each doc in other_docs

            h2 Documentation Development

            p The documentation for #{project} is just as important as the code itself. Where feasible, the source of all documentation is developed alongside the code within the main repository. This allows developers to keep it up to date as part of their regular work flow.

            p If you find something incomplete, incorrect or incomprehensible, please report this as an issue on the <a href="https://github.com/BreakawayLabs/mom/issues">task tracker</a>.
